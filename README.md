# Shiny-App-for-Al-Si-Mg-Alloys
Solidification Range in Al-Si-Mg Alloys with Shiny App

Equilibrium computational results from open-source OpenCalphad software <http://www.opencalphad.com/>, coupled with COST507 thermodynamic database for light alloys <http://www.opencalphad.com/databases.html>, were used to fit three multiple polynomial regressions to predict the liquidus, solidus, and the solidification range of Al-Si-Mg alloys. The models were implemented as a Shiny app and uploaded to RStudio server <https://kajinic.shinyapps.io/Al-Si-Mg/>.
