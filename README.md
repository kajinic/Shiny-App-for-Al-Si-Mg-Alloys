# Shiny-App-for-Al-Si-Mg-Alloys
Solidification Range in Al-Si-Mg Alloys with Shiny App

Equilibrium computational results from open-source OpenCalphad software, coupled with COST507 thermodynamic database for light alloys, were used to fit three multiple polynomial regressions to predict the liquidus, solidus, and the solidification range of Al-Si-Mg alloys. The models were implemented as a Shiny app and uploaded to RStudio server.
